- Backk will be always backward compatible
- No need to learn new type system, types are same as in Typescript (as opposed to GraphQl)
- Validation is ALWAYS required for literal types: numbers and string (as compared to GraphQl)
- Database upgrades are open for extension and closed for modification (Open-Close principle)
