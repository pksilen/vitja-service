# Vitja service

TODO:
- Timestamp tests
- DefaultJwtAuthenticationService
- Null value support for fields (createOrder: trackingUrl ja deliveredTime nulls)
- Class spread operator support in parsing class files
    class Jee {
        ...Id
        ...Password
        Omit<User , 'password'>
        Pick<Order, 'deliveryTimestamp' | 'trackingUrl'>

- Move order delivery status, trackingUrl and deliveredTimestamp to shopping cart item
- Test deliveredTimestamp to be either null or value depending on delivery status field
- Possible to delete shopping cart item from order if it is not yet delivered
- Table column indexing annotation
- sorting, includeResponseFields and excludeResponseFields must checked that they contain only allowed field names

- By default following fields are Hashed (and salted), or use @NotHashed annotation
    - password

  - X-content-type-options: nosniff
  - Strict-Transport-Security: max-age 
 - Own remote service function executor (Http)
     - call('http://app-service-dns-name/serviceName.functionName', inputArgObj)
     - env variable USE_FAKE_REMOTE_SERVICES_IN_TESTS (default true)
- Custom readinessProbe should use defaultReadinessProbe plus all other services it is using

- Mongodb transactions, update/delete preconditions

- User, add role field, joka voi olla createUserissa vain "user"
- userName should be capitalized when comparing existence
- userName should checked first that it does not exist (case-insensitive)
- loginService hook to perform eg. account validation email sending

    - app-service-dns-name is a topic eg. 'my-service.my-namespace' and message key is serviceName.functionName and message body is argument
    - By default creates topic if not existing, if you want service to creates its own topics, 
      create a readiness probe that returns true when needed topics are available
- Optimoi sivutus, jos order by:t√§ ei ole annettu:
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_(SQL)#Method_with_filter_(it_is_more_sophisticated_but_necessary_for_very_big_dataset)
- Kafka service, create function(s) in Kafkacontroller for processing different topic(s)
- ExpectInTestsToMatch annotation to include support for import libraries like lodash or moment
- ExpectInTestToMatch annotation to include support for other properties in response object
- Add Avro schema generation and content type support (avro-js)
